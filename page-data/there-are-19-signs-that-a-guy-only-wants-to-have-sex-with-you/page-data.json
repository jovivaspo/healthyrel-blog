He doesn't want to be more than a phone call.\n\n Some guys prefer to have dates in another city. That is a red flag if the two of you are not hanging out together.\n\n## There is a FAQ\n\n### I don't know why I attract guys who want to sleep with me\n\n Maybe this is not a problem with you. People that are like us can sometimes be attracted to us. You may attract other people who are also emotionally unavailable if you are emotionally unavailable. There will always be men that are interested in sex because you're attractive, regardless of what you want.\n\n### Does he want to be with me in the future?\n\n Men will show signs that they want to be with you in the future. Future plans will be made with you and they will talk about them. He won't mind hanging out with you in public, and will introduce you to your friends and family.\n\n### Why doesn't he want me to be his girlfriend?\n\n He doesn't want to have a relationship with anyone or he doesn't think the two of you are compatible. Whether or not to have children is something you have different goals for. It is possible that you have clashing personality. He doesn't want to hurt your feelings so he won't tell you.\n\n## The choice is up to you\n\n It is more likely that he wants to sleep you if you see more of the signs.
