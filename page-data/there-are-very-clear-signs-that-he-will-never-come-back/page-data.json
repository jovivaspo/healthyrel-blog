We want to believe that our ex will return to us. There are certain signs that he won't come back, and this is not always the case.\n\n## It didn't end well\n\n He will not come back if the relationship ended badly. Negative feelings towards you and the relationship are what he will have. He may be upset with you. It's best to find a new person if it didn't end well.\n\n## There are some things that can't be said in public\n\n It is unlikely that he will come back if some things were said during the relationship. He may not be able to forgive you because of the hurt that these things may have caused. It is best to move on if this is the case.\n\n## He isn't going to come back to you\n\n It is a sign that he doesn't want to talk to you if you have been trying to get in touch with him. He doesn't want to revisit the past because he has moved on. The best course of action is to move on.\n\n## You're not allowed to do so\n\n Did you ever try to find him on social media? It's a sign that he doesn't want to do anything with you if you can't find him. He doesn't want you in his life because he has moved on.\n\n## He's in a relationship with a new person\n\n It's a sign that he won't come back to you when he's dating someone new. There is no place for you in his life now that he has found someone he wants to be with. The best thing to do is to move on.\n\n## He's moved on socially\n\n He doesn't go to the places you used to go with him, he's no longer active on social media, and he avoids your social circle. It's a sign that he's moved on emotionally as well and there's no going back.\n\n## He talks about you in a very bad way\n\n It is likely that he will never come back if he talks bad about you to other people. He doesn't want to be with you because he has no respect for you.\n\n## He isn't going to respond to your messages\n\n It is a sign that he doesn't want to talk to you if he doesn't respond to your messages when you try to contact him. He doesn't want to revisit the past because he has moved on.\n\n## His friends are not fond of you\n\n It is likely that he will never come back if his friends don't like you. They can see that he is not interested in getting back together because they know him better than you do.\n\n## He has moved away\n\n He will not be coming back if he is moving away. It just doesn't work from an actual practical point of view if he wants to start a new life without you.\n\n## The body language has been guarded\n\nGiving defensive body language such as crossed arms or not facing you when talking is an unconscious way of guarding himself and sending a message that he is not interested.\n\n## He is not jealous anymore\n\n He no longer cares about you if you don't jealousy. He is no longer interested in you and may have moved on. He doesn't care at all.\n\n## He doesn't really care about your life\n\n He is not interested in you anymore if he doesn't ask about your life. He may not be interested in what's happening in your life anymore.\n\n## Even in a non-Romantic way, he's not physical with you\n\n It is a sign that he has lost interest in you if he doesn't want to be physical with you anymore. He is more interested in someone else.\n\n## He's not going to be there for you anymore\n\n Did he help you when you needed him or was he there for you when you needed him? It's a sign that he doesn't care about you anymore.\n\n## Past issues are brought up\n\n He's not over the past issues, that's a sign. If he can't move on from the past, he may never come back. It's possible that he can't forgive you for something you did.\n\n## He is not as excited to see you\n\n It is a sign that he has lost interest in you if he is not as excited to see you anymore. It would be difficult to see this, so you're going to have to work on it.\n\n## It is always busy\n\n It's a sign that someone is avoiding you when they're always busy. If they are busy and don't have time for you, they may never come back. They could be making up excuses, or this could be legitimate.\n\n## You are a friend zoned\n\n Do you become more of a friend now that you know each other? He will never come back to you if he has placed you in the friend zone. He might see you as a friend. He isn't interested in you romantically or sexually, that's the reason.\n\n## The relationship you had was toxic\n\n A toxic relationship isn't healthy. A toxic relationship is a sign that he will never come back. He doesn't want to go back to that because it wasn't good for you.\n\n## The bottom line is what it is\n\n There are a lot of signs that he won't return. It is best to move on if you see any of the signs, as he has already moved on. You don't need to wait for someone who doesn't want to be with you to be with you.\n\nThe content is accurate and true to the best of the author's knowledge, but is not meant to be a substitute for formal and individualized advice from a qualified professional.","childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>This post is just for you if you are looking for signs that he won't come back.
