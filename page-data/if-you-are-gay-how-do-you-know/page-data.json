Is not knowing your sexuality normal?\n\nAnswer: There is a person who is A. It's not always clear what a person's sexuality is. Something that fits into a neat box may be more complicated than they think. Experiences that make you feel different may be what you have. It is possible to be fluid with sexuality.\n\n People don't have a lot of sexual desire, so sexuality isn't clear. They don't like either sex. It's fine. It can be difficult to know what you want when you don't have a strong desire.\n\n### Question: Is there a way to ask a question? Is it possible to change my sexual preferences?\n\nAnswer: There is a person who is A. The hormones and brain will decide what is attractive. It could make you feel frustrated and depressed if you try to mess with that sexuality.\n\n A lot of people try to hide their sexuality in order to get married to someone of the opposite sex because they think it's more accepted. After many years of marriage, my friends found they couldn't ignore their gayness, even though they wanted to be bisexual. After getting divorced, they found partners that were more honest.\n\n If you have your attractions for the opposite sex or the same sex, you can't bury them. You have to tell yourself the truth. It might feel like you are writing with the wrong hand if you are trying to be with someone who doesn't fit your preferences.","childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<h2 id=\"if-im-gay-how-do-i-know\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#if-im-gay-how-do-i-know\" aria-label=\"if im gay how do i know permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>If I'm gay, how do I know?</h2>\n<p>sexuality is not a litmus test.

To figure out your sexuality, consider what's going on in your mind and what you're doing. You've had a lot of crushes since you were a young person. As young as elementary school, some people start to have crushes. It's obvious to many of them. It's not clear for others. It's possible that you don't have as strong of a sex drive as other people do. . . It's hard to tell if you like men or women. It is possible that you don't want a relationship at all.\n\n If you already know what kind of people you like, you don't need to experiment with what you like. If you flirt someone up for fun, you might come off as a tease, but you're not attracted to that sex and you don't feel that strongly about the person. People sometimes try to be cool.","childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<h3 id=\"question-is-there-a-way-to-ask-a-question-is-there-anything-that-indicates-im-gay\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#question-is-there-a-way-to-ask-a-question-is-there-anything-that-indicates-im-gay\" aria-label=\"question is there a way to ask a question is there anything that indicates im gay permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Question: Is there a way to ask a question?

A lot of people do things when they have a crush.</p>\n<h3 id=\"question-is-there-a-way-to-ask-a-question-is-it-necessary-for-me-to-experiment-to-figure-out-my-sexuality\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#question-is-there-a-way-to-ask-a-question-is-it-necessary-for-me-to-experiment-to-figure-out-my-sexuality\" aria-label=\"question is there a way to ask a question is it necessary for me to experiment to figure out my sexuality permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Question: Is there a way to ask a question? Is it necessary for me to experiment to figure out my sexuality?</h3>\n<p>Answer: There is a person who is A. I don't think so. To figure out your sexuality, consider what's going on in your mind and what you're doing. You've had a lot of crushes since you were a young person. As young as elementary school, some people start to have crushes. It's obvious to many of them. It's not clear for others. It's possible that you don't have as strong of a sex drive as other people do. . . It's hard to tell if you like men or women. It is possible that you don't want a relationship at all.</p>\n<p>If you already know what kind of people you like, you don't need to experiment with what you like. If you flirt someone up for fun, you might come off as a tease, but you're not attracted to that sex and you don't feel that strongly about the person. People sometimes try to be cool.</p>","tableOfContents":"<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#question-is-there-a-way-to-ask-a-question-is-there-anything-that-indicates-im-gay\">Question: Is there a way to ask a question?

Is it possible that I could make someone gay?\n\nAnswer: There is a person who is A. I don't think so. If someone doesn't like people of the same sex, there isn't a way to change that. If they really don't have an attraction to same-sex people, then you should experiment with them. . . It is possible that they will eventually leave you and find a better fit.\n\nDon't make anyone try to be a sexual being that they aren't.\n\n### Question: Is there a way to ask a question? If I come out of the closet, what would my family think about me?\n\nAnswer: There is a person who is A. Before you make a full announcement, you may want to test the waters. It's a good chance that your family already knows. Sometimes they don't know what they're talking about. Your family may react poorly if they are very old-fashioned and conservative. They may be resistant to your announcement because they have focused on the wrong aspects of dogma. There is no one-size-fits-all answer. The dynamic of each family is their own. Regardless of who you're attracted to, there are people that will love you no matter who you are. You can decide who will be your family as an adult. It is possible that close friends will become a family to you.\n\n Don't let the opinions of others distract you. It's their problem if someone doesn't want you to be accepted or welcome. They can be better to you if they work through that, but you can't be sure. Is it possible that people have got past this? It is possible for people to change and be more open minded. Some people don't know a lot about the lesbian, gay, bisexual and queer community and don't think about it very much, so it's possible to be nicer to gay family members by getting more educated.\n\n If your family doesn't accept you, I'm sorry. There are people in this world who won't be bothered by who you date. It's not anyone's business but yours. Make sure you follow safe practices when you do something.\n\n Take a look at what your family watches on TV and what they read. It is possible that this will give you an indication of whether they will be friendly to you or not.\n\n### Question: Is there a way to ask a question? Does that mean I'm gay if I have a dream about the same sex?\n\nAnswer: There is a person who is A. When it comes to sexuality, dreams shouldn't be taken too seriously. Your brain likes to tell it's stories when you're asleep. It's common to have sexual dreams that don't correspond to what you really want. When you have a dream about a same-sex encounter, some psychologists think it's a sign that you're trying to understand your gender.\n\n When it comes to sexuality, dreams wouldn't be the only variable. When you sleep, a lot can get crazy. It may be more erotic than you would think. It doesn't mean that you don't want to do anything. You shouldn't punish yourself for having crazy dreams.\n\n It doesn't mean that you actually want to be a flying pig if you have a dream about it. It doesn't mean that you want to go to prison if you have a dream that you are in a prison and getting tortured. It's not necessarily prophetic to have dreams. Don't expect all of your dreams to be meaningful, you might have an intuitive dream every once in a while.\n\n### Question: Is there a way to ask a question? If I had a sexual encounter with someone of the same sex and never pursued it again, what would it be like?\n\nAnswer: There is a person who is A. A good example of experimentation is this one. People try to have an intimate relationship with a same-sex partner. It's not really for them at the end of the day. When you're in a relationship with someone of the opposite sex, you may find that you don't have the same feelings for them as you do for someone of the same sex.\n\n It's fine to say you're straight after experimenting with your sexuality. You can take on different partners of both genders, but you prefer one over the other. It's a good idea to focus on your preference, not just having sex for the sake of it. It could mean you have a sex addiction if you have sex with others just for the sake of it.\n\n### Question: Is there a way to ask a question? If I can't kiss someone of the same sex, what do I do?\n\nAnswer: There is a person who is A. You can't kiss someone who is the same sex if you're attracted to them. . . You might want to look at what is happening.\n\n You like the idea of it if you aren't actually attracted to the person. You think the person is pretty, even if you aren't actually attracted to them. If you want to copy their look for yourself, you might actually want to have sex with them.\n\n If someone kissing the same sex makes you uncomfortable, squeamish, awkward, so on and so forth. . . You're probably not interested in them at all. Kissing someone you like should feel natural, even if you are young and new to it.\n\n You're putting on the brakes because of something. Are you like this with both men and women? Don't be forced to do something you don't want to do.\n\n### Question: Is there a way to ask a question? Do I have to worry about my sexuality if my religion goes against it?\n\nAnswer: There is a person who is A. When it comes to sexuality and gender, several religions put people into boxes. It is important that you feel supported and loved. There is a version of your religion that is more accepting of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and queer community.\n\n There are some people in the world who face more severe challenges when it comes to expressing their sexuality. This puts them at risk and causes a lot of pain. I don't think you should pretend that you have a different sexuality than the one you actually do. You won't be ostracized by religions. For your safety, it may be better to move to another country. You have the resources to make it better for yourself if you are in a situation like this.\n\n It is important to make sure you are safe. It's a good idea to reach out to people who are accepting of LGBT+ people. Religion has a tendency to have homophobia in it.\n\n Being gay isn't a bad thing for you. It is a universal rule among religions that you should focus on what you can do to be good to others. Don't let yourself get carried away with the attraction you have. Your hormones and experiences will determine your sexuality.\n\n Every person's hormones are different and this can affect how you think. Not everyone has the same chromosomes. A friend of mine had Y chromosomes when she was a girl. It's fine that people are biologically diverse.\n\n## Further reading is on the way\n\nThe content is accurate and true to the best of the author's knowledge, but is not meant to be a substitute for formal and individualized advice from a qualified professional.","childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<h3 id=\"question-is-there-a-way-to-ask-a-question-is-it-possible-that-i-could-make-someone-gay\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#question-is-there-a-way-to-ask-a-question-is-it-possible-that-i-could-make-someone-gay\" aria-label=\"question is there a way to ask a question is it possible that i could make someone gay permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Question: Is there a way to ask a question?
