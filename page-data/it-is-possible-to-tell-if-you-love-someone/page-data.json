Negative emotions and confrontation can be overcome by love. superficial feelings and assumptions aren't quite so robust when it comes to crushes.</p>\n<p>It's easy to fall apart from a relationship based on a crush. A person living up to an idealized version of themselves is why crushes are not very flexible. If the person acts in a way that you didn't expect, the good feelings disappear as soon as the heart-shaped bubble pops.</p>\n<p>You are more willing to work things out if you are in love with someone.
