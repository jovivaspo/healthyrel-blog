This is a list of people who have had a divorce.\n\n## What do you mean by divorce registry?\n\n When a couple gets married their households are merged. They get rid of one item and keep the other, because they don't need two of everything. They ask for items that they don't have.\n\n Marriages don't work out all the time. It is sad when a couple gets divorced. It can be difficult for one or both of the individuals, since splitting up also means splitting their belongings, most of which they now only have one. The person who gets the microwave. Is the vacuum a thing? The computer or the sound system?\n\n If a split is equitable, each person will have only a few items that they need. Two people who are divorcing can afford to set up separate households because of the financial considerations. After a divorce, people are less well off than before.\n\n A new opportunity has been created to help people who are divorcing when they can't afford everything they need. The establishment of divorce registries is what this is about.

The continued stigma surrounding divorce is the main reason for this.\n\n Many who have been divorced say that they experience daily judgement from people because their marriage has failed, even though there is generally greater acceptance of divorce in recent years. Some people who are divorced stay in their marriages longer because they fear being stigmatized as a divorcee. More than a third of those surveyed said they tried to save their marriage because they knew they would be viewed as failures if they got divorced.\n\n Many people don't like divorce registries because they don't think it's a good way to celebrate a divorce. A number of people still feel that it is not necessary to announce a divorce in order to complete the process quietly. A divorce registry equates divorce with marriage, while marriage is seen as something positive and divorce is not.\n\n Because of these factors, owners are hesitant to set up divorce registries because of concerns over public opinion and whether or not it would affect their bottom line.

In order to register for stores of their choice, people have to pretend to be married or have a baby, which can limit the types of items that are available.\n\n## There are negative feelings that get in the way of forming others\n\n Even if someone feels they can register for things after a marriage ends, they may not be able to sign up. They may have feelings of shame and guilt if they ask for things in a divorce. They may wonder if they need the items they would like to ask for and how others will view them asking for gifts. A lot of people register for expensive items that they don't need but want to receive as a kind of \"dream gifts\" or things they would never purchase for themselves at a wedding. They may feel that people need to believe that they were unable to purchase items due to financial hardship for it to be asked.\n\n When they registered for wedding gifts, they noticed that there were some feelings and concerns that didn't come up.

For a lot of them, the idea of participating in a divorce registry may seem like something they shouldn't do because of how others might view it.\n\n## There are conclusions\n\n When it comes to getting divorced, there are plenty of options out there, but how do you get started? Some people think that divorce is not something that should be celebrated like marriage and that there is still a stigma associated with it. Individuals who might otherwise want to take advantage of such a registry may be reluctant to do so because of the belief that their divorce indicates failure and shouldn't be rewarded. They feel offended by the belief that the individual views divorce positively, which may be why they don't ask for gifts.\n\n Sometimes family and friends don't know how to help when a person gets divorced. It isn't in keeping with society's norm to ask someone what they need financially in terms of items they don't have anymore. A registry would make it easier for people who care about someone getting a divorce to do so, as well as make it more acceptable for them to do so.","childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Elianore is a Ph.
